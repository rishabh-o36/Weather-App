# 🌦 Weather App (JavaScript Project)

This is a simple Weather Application I built while learning **JavaScript** and understanding how APIs work.

It fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather condition with dynamic UI updates and animations.

## 📚 What I Learned

While building this project, I learned:

- How to use `fetch()` to make API calls
- How APIs work and return JSON data
- How to handle asynchronous JavaScript using `async/await`
- How to manipulate the DOM dynamically
- How to handle errors (like invalid city names)
- How to deploy a frontend project using Vercel
- How to add animations and transitions using CSS

## 🌍 What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) allows two applications to communicate with each other.

In this project:

- My JavaScript app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API
- The API returns weather data in JSON format
- I extract that data and display it on the webpage

Example API Request:
